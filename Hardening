Watch the video in week 13 and answer below questions

1- What is a script?
	A script is an executable file that contains commands to accomplish specific tasks.


2- How can you run a script that does not have execute permission?
	There two ways to do that:
		1- You can do: sh fileName. 
		2- You can make a copy of the file containing the script and 
		change the permission of that copy with chmod +x 


3- What is a for loop?
	It is a bash programming language statement which allows a code to be repeatedly executed.  
	It is classified as an iteration statement, that is the repetition of a process within a bash script.


4- How do you close an if statement?
	You close an if statement with fi. 


5- What is your experience using awk and sed command?
	I am proficient in using the sed and awk commands in bash shell scripting. 
	I have used the awk command at my previous job to work on several projects, one of which was 
	to write a script that would audit the entire Centos system. 
	I had to use the awk command to filter and extract data for that script. 
	The sed command was also helpful in inserting and replacing some lines into my script. 


10- Data service staff you with a company , and they want you to advise or help them secure their ubuntu servers. How would you do that? 
	I would use the CIS Benchmark documentation as a guide to secure their ubuntu servers.
